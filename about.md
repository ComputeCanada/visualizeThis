### (Frequently Asked Questions)

> How do I register to participate in the Visualize This! Challenge?

Anyone interested in this competition must <a
href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/4th-annual-visualize-this-challenge-registration-71335547543"
target="_blank">register your interest here</a>. If you have any questions, please contact us
[via email](mailto:viz-challenge@westgrid.ca).

> Can we work in a team?

Yes, participants can form teams, but a team will be considered as a single entrant and will be eligible
to win only one prize.

> Is there a limit to how many people can be on a team?

No. There is no limit to the number of people who can be part of your team. It can be as large or as
small as you like.

> Do all team members need to register their interest?

No. Only one member of the team needs to register your interest in the challenge. Click <a
href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/4th-annual-visualize-this-challenge-registration-71335547543"
target="_blank">here</a> to register your interest.

> What are the deadlines?

The dataset will be available on Cedar, Graham, Niagara, and Béluga clusters from October 1, with
submissions due by midnight Pacific Time on November 30, 2019. Winners will be announced in December.

> How will my application be judged?

Submissions will be reviewed by members of the Compute Canada Visualization Team. Points will be given
for:
- interactive visualizations,
- visualizing the 3D multi-scale nature of the data,
- online presentation in a browser, and
- clear innovative display of multiple variables.

> Who is eligible to participate?

The competition is open to anyone affiliated with a Canadian post-secondary institution (college or
university) or research organization. Participants from all research fields are encouraged to enter. The
competition datasets provide a valuable learning opportunity to enhance your visualization skills, no
matter what your research area may be.

> I have never used WestGrid or Compute Canada resources before. Can I still participate in the
> Challenge?

Yes. Assuming that you are using your own data, your visualization does not need to be developed or
implemented on WestGrid or Compute Canada's platforms. However, if you would like to use WestGrid or
Compute Canada computational resources for your visualization, or if you want to access the default
dataset, you can register for a free account <a
href="https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account"
target="_blank">here</a>. If you have any questions about getting an account, please email
*accounts@computecanada.ca*. Please note that the default dataset is provided on Cedar, Graham, Niagara,
and Béluga clusters for which you need a Compute Canada account.

You don't need a Compute Canada account if you want to visualize your own dataset on a third-party
distributed-memory machine.

> I am not affiliated with a Canadian university, post-secondary institution, or research
> organization. Can I participate in the Challenge?

Yes. If you partner with or join a team of someone who is affiliated with a Canadian university,
post-secondary institution or research organization, you can participate in the Visualize This!
Challenge.

> I don’t live in Canada, but I have a WestGrid or Compute Canada account. Can I participate in the
> challenge?

Yes. If you have a WestGrid or Compute Canada account and are registered in the Compute Canada DataBase
(CCDB), you are eligible to participate in the Visualize This! Challenge, even if you are not living in
Canada.

> What visualization tools can be used in the competition?

Participants can use any parallel, open-source visualization tool such as ParaView and VisIt. You can
also use Javascript/WebGL tools and/or Python visualization libraries if you adapt them to perform
distributed rendering on a cluster.

<!-- domain-specific packages, online Javascript/WebGL tools, Python visualization libraries, or any other -->
<!-- open-source software you feel comfortable using. -->

<!-- We hosted a kickoff webinar on Sept 27 that gave a walk-through of the dataset and gave some examples of -->
<!-- visualization tools that can be used. Click here to view the archive recording (to get right to the -->
<!-- dataset tour, skip ahead to 4:04 in the video). -->

> Will any technical support be provided to participants?

If you have a specific technical question, please [email us](mailto:viz-challenge@westgrid.ca). In
general, we expect participants to create their own visualization(s), so technical help will be limited
to answering very specific questions.

<!-- Our kickoff workshop will share more details on the dataset, supply sample routines to read the data, and -->
<!-- demonstrate a few basic visualization examples. Click here to register for the workshop. -->

> Who owns the Intellectual Property (IP) rights?

The default dataset for this year's competition was kindly provided by Joshua Brinkerhoff (UBC Okanagan)
and is covered by the usual university copyright policies. Participants own the rights to their
visualization, but not to the default dataset, if they choose to use it. By submitting an application to
the Visualize This!  Challenge, the participant is providing consent for the use, reproduction,
publication, transmission and/or broadcasting of his/her name, likeness, and/or prize information, and
the solution, without compensation, in any publication or promotion by WestGrid or Compute Canada for the
purposes of promoting the competition, the winners, and/or the benefits of visualization to research.

> Can I use my own dataset?

Yes, as long as it requires rendering on a distributed-memory machine (parallel HPC cluster).

<!-- No. In both the scientific and humanities tracks, all participants will work with the same dataset, which -->
<!-- has been provided to the Challenge by a researcher. Both datasets will be made available on the -->
<!-- competition webpage, and participants can download it anytime after October 1, 2019. -->

<!-- We hosted a kickoff webinar on Sept 27 that gave a walk-through of the -->
<!-- dataset. Click here to view the archive recording (to get right to the dataset tour, skip ahead to 4:04 -->
<!-- in the video). -->

> How do I submit my solution?

Solutions must be submitted [via email](mailto:viz-challenge@westgrid.ca).

Please follow these instructions when submitting:
- Submit both your visualization and the workflow, be it a script, a state file, etc. so that we can
  reproduce your solution.
- If you have any large files (over 1 MB), do not attach them to the email. Instead, share them with us
  using any of the popular sharing tools such as Dropbox, Google Drive, <a
  href="https://www.westgrid.ca/resources_services/data_storage/cloud_storage" target="_blank">WestGrid's
  ownCloud</a>, <a href="https://transfer.sh" target="_blank">transfer.sh</a>, <a
  href="https://wetransfer.com" target="_blank">WeTransfer</a>, or a shared cluster filesystem. With
  multiple files please pack and compress them into an archive before uploading.

> When do I submit my solution?

Participants can submit their solutions at any time during the competition between October 1, 2019 (12:01
am PST) and November 30, 2019 (11:59 pm PST). Late submissions will not be considered.

> Can I submit more than once?

Yes. Each submission will be time-stamped and the last submission received before the deadline date/time
from each participant will be what is considered the final for submission.








<!-- Some words about scientific visualization and distributed rendering in particular. -->

<!-- raise awareness of the essential role visualization can play in helping researchers explore large -->
<!-- datasets to answer important scientific questions -->

<!-- “Visualization has the potential to help researchers better understand, illustrate and glean insight from their data. Compute Canada has the resources and expertise to support all stages of visualization, from preparing data to interactive analysis. We’re working to engage more scientists, across all disciplines, to tap the power and the promise of visualization for research,” says Alex Razoumov, Compute Canada Visualization Team Lead and a Visualization Coordinator with <a href="http://www.westgrid.ca/">WestGrid</a>. -->
