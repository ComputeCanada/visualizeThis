## What is the *Visualize This!* Challenge?

Now in its third year, *Visualize This!* is a Canada-wide competition that aims to celebrate the
innovative ways visualization can help researchers explore datasets and answer important scientific
questions. *Visualize This!* is your chance to challenge your creativity, experiment with new
visualization tools, and contribute to the growth of data visualization in Canada!

This year’s *Visualize This!* Challenge is hosted by WestGrid, a regional partner of Compute
Canada. Together with the Compute Canada Visualization Team, we want to bring your creative visualization
ideas and workflows to life and make them accessible to all Canadian researchers!

To participate in the Challenge, please [register your interest]().




<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. -->

<!-- To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. -->

<!-- Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: -->

<!-- {% highlight ruby %} -->
<!-- def print_hi(name) -->
<!--   puts "Hi, #{name}" -->
<!-- end -->
<!-- print_hi('Tom') -->
<!-- #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT. -->
<!-- {% endhighlight %} -->

<!-- Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk]. -->
