We will describe here a couple of open source visualization tools.
This years, the "Visualize This challenge focuses in parallel rendering and large datastes that could not be done with a simple workstation.
Hence paralel processing fo the data and execution of the visualization pipeline is needed.
Both of the tools we describe in the followiing sections are designed with visualization and HPC principles in mind.
They are cross-platform, ie., they can run in different Operating Systems, although we will again recommend and require that participants execute their visualization pipelines and renderings in a cluster enviroment taking advantage of parallel rendering.
They are perfectly well suited for running in HPC cluster environments, can run in client-server mode and take full advantage of multi-core and multi-node architectures, as well as, batch rendering.

Of course there are many other tools that can be used, but here we will restrict to discuss and present, VisIt and ParaView.

### VisIt
Currently developed and maintained by Lawrence Livermore National Lab, https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/.
VisIt is an Open Source, interactive, scalable, visualization, animation and analysis tool.
VisIt can read hundred of different file formats, including OpenFOAM ones.

VisIt documentation: https://visit-sphinx-github-user-manual.readthedocs.io/


### ParaView
Originally started as a collaboration between Los Alamos National Lab and Kitware, currently is developed and mantained by Kitware, https://www.paraview.org/.
ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization application.
ParaView can read hundred of different file formats, inclduing OpenFOAM ones.

For isntance for loading the data from this challegne, you just need to locate the XXXX file and open it in ParaView.
