  <p>Now in its 4th year, <i>Visualize This!</i> is a Canada-wide competition that aims to celebrate the
  innovative ways visualization can help researchers explore datasets and answer important scientific
  questions. <i>Visualize This!</i> is your chance to challenge your creativity, experiment with new
  visualization tools, and contribute to the growth of data visualization in Canada!</p>

  <p>This year's <i>Visualize This!</i> Challenge is hosted by WestGrid, SciNet, SHARCNET, and Calcul
  Qu√©bec -- three regional partners of Compute Canada. Together with
    <!-- (the-list-of-sponsors) and -->
    the Compute Canada's
  Visualization Team, we want to bring your creative visualization ideas and workflows to life and make
  them accessible to all Canadian researchers!</p>
